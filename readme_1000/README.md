According to the author, Echidna had a book that was extremely important to her, to the point it changed her destiny.

However, the author then went on to say it was a spoiler, thus not revealing what the book is.

Re: Zero's Arc 7 began with Rem in Chapter One asking Subaru who he was as well as who she herself was.

In contrast, the final chapter of the Arc ended with Rem only asking who Shotabaru was. A contrast that was likely planned by the author.

Rem and Ram were originally designed to look expressionless in Volume 2. However, after Tappei and the editor both said "They're popular, so make them cute", the illustrator, Otsuka re-did them, also improving their maid outfits so they'd look less plain.

Today, the 17th of March in Japan, is the day which "Choose Me" aired during Season Two of the Anime.

It's also the day Tappei told people to celebrate Beatrice's birthday, as her actual birthday is a spoiler.

Happy provisional birthday!

Among the characters the author confirmed would probably be getting a named chapter in Arc 7 was Garfiel Tinsel, in 2017.

However, it seems this decision was postponed as with Arc 7 completed, he still has not received one.

Let's hope for Arc 8!

The "Stone" Muspel is said to move "in a big way" every 12 years. The results of its movements cause massive earthquakes to occur sometime afterward.

His location soon after Vincent met Chisha for the first time was the Gairahal Tropics.
