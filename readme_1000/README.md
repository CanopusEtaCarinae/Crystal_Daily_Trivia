Re: Zero's Arc 7 began with Rem in Chapter One asking Subaru who he was as well as who she herself was.

In contrast, the final chapter of the Arc ended with Rem only asking who Shotabaru was. A contrast that was likely planned by the author.

Rem and Ram were originally designed to look expressionless in Volume 2. However, after Tappei and the editor both said "They're popular, so make them cute", the illustrator, Otsuka re-did them, also improving their maid outfits so they'd look less plain.
