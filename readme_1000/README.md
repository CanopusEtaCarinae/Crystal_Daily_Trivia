According to the author, Echidna had a book that was extremely important to her, to the point it changed her destiny.

However, the author then went on to say it was a spoiler, thus not revealing what the book is.

Tappei Nagatsuki is known for referencing many Japanese series and pieces of pop culture in Re: Zero.

Among them, he even made a reference to Attack on Titan in Chapter 15 of Arc 7, after Subaru and the others arrived in the walled city of Guaral.

Among the references Tappei had made to popular works of fiction in Re: Zero, one of them is to Togashi's  Hunter x Hunter.

In Arc 6, Chapter 14, Subaru advises to take the right path following Kurapika's advice in the Hunter Exam.

According to Kadokawa producer, Tanaka Shou, White Fox was first chosen to adapt Re: Zero due to their attention to detail, the care they put into their work, and the faith and respect they show to the source material.

Re: Zero's Arc 7 began with Rem in Chapter One asking Subaru who he was as well as who she herself was.

In contrast, the final chapter of the Arc ended with Rem only asking who Shotabaru was. A contrast that was likely planned by the author.

Rem and Ram were originally designed to look expressionless in Volume 2. However, after Tappei and the editor both said "They're popular, so make them cute", the illustrator, Otsuka re-did them, also improving their maid outfits so they'd look less plain.

Today, the 17th of March in Japan, is the day which "Choose Me" aired during Season Two of the Anime.

It's also the day Tappei told people to celebrate Beatrice's birthday, as her actual birthday is a spoiler.

Happy provisional birthday!

Among the characters the author confirmed would probably be getting a named chapter in Arc 7 was Garfiel Tinsel, in 2017.

However, it seems this decision was postponed as with Arc 7 completed, he still has not received one.

Let's hope for Arc 8!

The "Stone" Muspel is said to move "in a big way" every 12 years. The results of its movements cause massive earthquakes to occur sometime afterward.

His location soon after Vincent met Chisha for the first time was the Gairahal Tropics.

According to Tappei, Subaru likely won't be eaten by small creatures again.

However, in the Talkshow, he reckoned being devoured by insects or a creature with a large mouth as perhaps different enough. He then thought of a good idea, which he may do later

When asked by a fan in 2017 what he thought about Mushoku Tensei, Tappei replied that people were missing out in their lives by not reading it.

He also added that its author, Rifujin na Maganote, was a really awesome person and a friend.

According to Tappei, one of the reasons why he is able to write so well is because since a long time ago, he used to like reading dictionaries, to the point that he would open one at random and have scavenger hunts to find the right words.

Since Arc 7, Ch. 43, Subaru has not referred to Beatrice by her "Beako" nickname once. Even when speaking to her after their reunion he's only ever used her full name.

This likely was done intentionally by Tappei to highlight Shotabaru's memory problems.

After Emilia broke free from the ice, Puck declared that she could depend on him, calling her by her actual name.

This was despite the fact Emilia had never told him his name up to that point, implying Puck may have had foreknowledge of it.

One of the books given to Beatrice by Geuse in Ep. 18 of Season 2's Breaktime, shown here, has a hidden Easter egg to it.

Its title when translated is "Kono subarashii sekai ni shukufuku wo", the title of the popular work "Konosuba" in Japanese.

Today, 4/29 in Japan, is Elsa Granhiert's birthday! Happy birthday!

The date is a play on the words "death" and "meat". Four (四) has the same pronunciation as death (死), while two (二) and nine (九) are pronounced "ni" and "ku", like meat (肉 ) - "niku".

According to Masaharu Watanabe, the Director of Re: Zero Season 1 & 2, the original plan for the ED Song of the iconic Episode 15 of Season 1 was to use a different song.

That changed the moment they heard Suehiro's Requiem of Silence, the rest is history.

The volumes are titled "The Saga of the Great Crusch-sama", just like the eponymous short story series.

Depending how you count, Re: Zero currently has 605 Web Novel chapters that make up the main story.

Currently, those who have watched both Seasons of the Anime have to read a whopping 305 Web Novel chapters to catch up from the end of Arc 4.
