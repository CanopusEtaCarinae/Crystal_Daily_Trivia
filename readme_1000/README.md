According to the author, Echidna had a book that was extremely important to her, to the point it changed her destiny.

However, the author then went on to say it was a spoiler, thus not revealing what the book is.

Tappei Nagatsuki is known for referencing many Japanese series and pieces of pop culture in Re: Zero.

Among them, he even made a reference to Attack on Titan in Chapter 15 of Arc 7, after Subaru and the others arrived in the walled city of Guaral.

Re: Zero's Arc 7 began with Rem in Chapter One asking Subaru who he was as well as who she herself was.

In contrast, the final chapter of the Arc ended with Rem only asking who Shotabaru was. A contrast that was likely planned by the author.

Rem and Ram were originally designed to look expressionless in Volume 2. However, after Tappei and the editor both said "They're popular, so make them cute", the illustrator, Otsuka re-did them, also improving their maid outfits so they'd look less plain.

It's also the day Tappei told people to celebrate Beatrice's birthday, as her actual birthday is a spoiler.

Happy provisional birthday!

Among the characters the author confirmed would probably be getting a named chapter in Arc 7 was Garfiel Tinsel, in 2017.

However, it seems this decision was postponed as with Arc 7 completed, he still has not received one.

Let's hope for Arc 8!

The "Stone" Muspel is said to move "in a big way" every 12 years. The results of its movements cause massive earthquakes to occur sometime afterward.

According to Tappei, Subaru likely won't be eaten by small creatures again.

However, in the Talkshow, he reckoned being devoured by insects or a creature with a large mouth as perhaps different enough. He then thought of a good idea, which he may do later

When asked by a fan in 2017 what he thought about Mushoku Tensei, Tappei replied that people were missing out in their lives by not reading it.

He also added that its author, Rifujin na Maganote, was a really awesome person and a friend.

Since Arc 7, Ch. 43, Subaru has not referred to Beatrice by her "Beako" nickname once. Even when speaking to her after their reunion he's only ever used her full name.

This likely was done intentionally by Tappei to highlight Shotabaru's memory problems.

This was despite the fact Emilia had never told him his name up to that point, implying Puck may have had foreknowledge of it.

Its title when translated is "Kono subarashii sekai ni shukufuku wo", the title of the popular work "Konosuba" in Japanese.

According to Masaharu Watanabe, the Director of Re: Zero Season 1 & 2, the original plan for the ED Song of the iconic Episode 15 of Season 1 was to use a different song.

That changed the moment they heard Suehiro's Requiem of Silence, the rest is history.

Currently, those who have watched both Seasons of the Anime have to read a whopping 305 Web Novel chapters to catch up from the end of Arc 4.

This old Q&A from about a decade ago was incorrectly translated in English as him totally being one, which is why I figured I'd correct it.
