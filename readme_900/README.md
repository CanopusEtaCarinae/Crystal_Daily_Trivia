Despite apparently never visiting the Pleiades Watchtower, let alone reaching its top, Emilia felt a strange sense of déjà vu about the handprints left on the monolith.

One of them even perfectly overlapped with her own hand.

When the author began to do Birthday Q&A's for his characters in 2017, he purposely announced he couldn't do one for Emilia.

This was because there was still heaps of stuff he hasn't talked about, with Emilia being full of mysteries.

In the Web Novel version of Re: Zero, Kadomon mentions hobbits as being a type of Demi-Human that are occasionally seen in the Royal Capital.

According to the author, Priscilla Barielle would probably be the only one among the Royal Candidates who wouldn't react in shock if her mansion burnt down.

On the contrary, according to the author, she would probably laugh.

Priscilla Barielle has so far been depicted to have kissed several characters in the series.

From them, these include Liliana, Arakiya, Al and a girl from the village of Coffleton. Each time, the kiss was for a stated non-romantic purpose.

Back when Arc Three of the Re: Zero Web Novel was first written and Priscilla was introduced, many readers thought she was a lolibaba due to the ambiguity in her description.

Many readers ended up being surprised by her busty official design.

The character who has appeared in most Re: Zero covers (including Tanpenshuu, EX and Zeropedia) is Emilia, with a whopping 10 cover appearances from a possible 46.

That puts her at around 20% chance of appearing on any given Re: Zero cover.
