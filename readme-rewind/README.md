**Re: Zero Trivia Rewind**

It is confirmed by the author, that if Subaru was told he had to chose between Emilia's panties or getting a hug from her, his answer would depend.

If it was in front of her, he would act unsure, but if Emilia wasn't there, he'd immediately chose the hug.

Despite having eight husbands in the past by the age of 18, Priscilla Barielle is still a virgin.

**Re: Zero Trivia Rewind**

According to the author, he enjoys writing all aspects of Subaru, including when he's being scummy, being cool or dying.

However, he explicitly stated that when it's Subaru dying, his fingers move without hesitation.
