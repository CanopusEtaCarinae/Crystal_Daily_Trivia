**Re: Zero Trivia Rewind**

It is confirmed by the author, that if Subaru was told he had to chose between Emilia's panties or getting a hug from her, his answer would depend.

If it was in front of her, he would act unsure, but if Emilia wasn't there, he'd immediately chose the hug.

**Re: Zero Trivia Rewind**

According to the author, he enjoys writing all aspects of Subaru, including when he's being scummy, being cool or dying.

However, he explicitly stated that when it's Subaru dying, his fingers move without hesitation.

**Re: Zero Trivia Rewind**

According to a past author Q&A, Frederica canonically wears flashy underwear, as a hidden design decision!

What colour do you all think she favours? 🤔

**Re: Zero Trivia Rewind**

The traces of a brick enclosure, once hosting a flowerbed tended to by Theresia, can be found in the unkempt garden of the main Astrea Mansion.

Felt tasked Reinhard in tending to it, to decide whether she'd end up liking flowers or not.

(I felt this was appropriate to bring back up again, given Felt's true name may have been based off the Italian word for flower.)
