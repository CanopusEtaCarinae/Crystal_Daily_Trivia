Priscilla Barielle's real name is Prisca Benedict. She's one of the children of Drizen Vollachia, 76th Vollachian Emperor. She lost the Imperial Selection due to her bodyguard Arrachia's lack of faith in her, resulting in her death being faked.

Reinhard had the Divine Protection of Mind-Changing when he was four. This D.P. is renown to be extremely dangerous since it can change someone's mind, even having the potential to topple nations.

It seems that Reinhard deleted this D.P. from himself.

Capella seems to be going after legacies that were left behind by the Witches 400 years ago. This was evident nine years ago when she commanded her "Son" Reisel to go after Scarfdona.

Reisel failed and as a result was transformed into something inhuman.

Roswaal J. Mathers died young, protecting her friend Carol Remendis from the blade of the Shinobi Shasuke. Her death was completely unexpected to her, and came only a short while before Volcanica appeared to heal Picoutatte from Valgren's incursion.

Frederica has rare blood flowing through her veins; among its properties it's said to even be able to captivate dragons.

Tappei has mentioned that Frederica's time to shine will be Arc 11, so she may be instrumental to Roswaal's plans against Volcanica

Sphinx is imprisoned underground the Barielle Territory and is biding her time for when to put her plans into action in creating a "Paradise".

It seems that the Zombies in Pride, Prejudice and Zombies were down to her "children" taking premature action.

Character limit didn't let me include this tidbit, but she's controlling a horde of rats which she regards as her "children", and conversely they regard her as their Creator. It's likely that the Parasite in Pride, Prejudice and Zombies was a result of one of Sphinx's creations.

There are 10 ridiculously powerful swords in Re Zero. All of their names have been revealed, but we don't know the whereabouts of some.

Of those we do, we have the Yang Sword, the Dragon Sword Reid, the Fiend Sword Murasame and the Dream Sword Masayume

Yae Tenzen was a maid that worked for the Barielle household that came under Priscilla's command when Leip died.

In "Pride, Prejudice and Zombies" Yae seemingly assassinated Priscilla but her death was seemingly reversed by Al, who then defeated Yae.

Volume 21 changed the way Subaru and his group broke through Sand Time. In the Light Novel, Ram used her Clairvoyance to share in one of the mysterious birds' senses so that they could follow it to a breach point.

Between Arc 4-5, Subaru, Otto and Garfiel all cross-dress to accompany Roswaal to a party organised by Gwain Merette.

They are known by their alter-egos Natsumi Schwartz, Audrey Souffle and Garnet Thuram. Audrey is the one that is hit on the most.

Clind, the mysterious Butler that works for Roswaal, has been with Roswaal since the beginning. Thus he too numbers in at over 400 years of age.

Clind has shown strange, yet potent combat abilities throughout the story despite being a "simple" Butler.

Melakuera was originally a Minute Spirit born of a bonfire tended by the youngest of a family of travelers.

The boy would pray to the fire for peace; on his death, the Spirit grew a sense of self and became the Arbitrator for the world for his friend.

Once again the Twitter char limit made me cut out a bunch of details. For example, Melakuera was initially the name of said boy. Melakuera took his name on his death. Also, he became the Arbitrator specifically to uphold his friend's prayers for peace and tranquility.
