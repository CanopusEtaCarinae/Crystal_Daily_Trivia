Priscilla Barielle's real name is Prisca Benedict. She's one of the children of Drizen Vollachia, 76th Vollachian Emperor. She lost the Imperial Selection due to her bodyguard Arrachia's lack of faith in her, resulting in her death being faked.

Reinhard had the Divine Protection of Mind-Changing when he was four. This D.P. is renown to be extremely dangerous since it can change someone's mind, even having the potential to topple nations.

It seems that Reinhard deleted this D.P. from himself.

Capella seems to be going after legacies that were left behind by the Witches 400 years ago. This was evident nine years ago when she commanded her "Son" Reisel to go after Scarfdona.

Reisel failed and as a result was transformed into something inhuman.

Sphinx is imprisoned underground the Barielle Territory and is biding her time for when to put her plans into action in creating a "Paradise".

It seems that the Zombies in Pride, Prejudice and Zombies were down to her "children" taking premature action.

Character limit didn't let me include this tidbit, but she's controlling a horde of rats which she regards as her "children", and conversely they regard her as their Creator. It's likely that the Parasite in Pride, Prejudice and Zombies was a result of one of Sphinx's creations.

Melakuera was originally a Minute Spirit born of a bonfire tended by the youngest of a family of travelers.

The boy would pray to the fire for peace; on his death, the Spirit grew a sense of self and became the Arbitrator for the world for his friend.

Once again the Twitter char limit made me cut out a bunch of details. For example, Melakuera was initially the name of said boy. Melakuera took his name on his death. Also, he became the Arbitrator specifically to uphold his friend's prayers for peace and tranquility.

味も大切ですが、基本量です。満腹感を満たすことだけが、ダフネの生き甲斐です。でも、拒食症も併発しているので食べたものをすぐ吐いてしまうこともあります。

三大魔獣でいちばんおいしいのはどれですか？
大兎が柔らかくて美味しいですが、白鯨は高値で取引されそうです。黒蛇は珍味ですが、毒抜き必須。そこまでして食いたいか

白鯨の唐揚げ、大兎のソテー、黒蛇の黒焼きの中で一番美味しいのはどれですか
その中なら大兎のソテーだろうけど、ソテーする前に食材にならないように頑張ってね。

白鯨や大兎、黒蛇は普通の人間が食べて美味しいと感じられます？
おいしいわけがない。「食えればいいや」の精神で作られた生き物だぞ。

大兎は美味しいんじゃないんでしたっけ？
食った奴がいないからわかんないよ。おいしいんじゃない？的な答えだよ。兎だし。クジラや蛇よりはマシだろう。

へびさんを食べれるということはダフネは病気にならないんですか？

Garfiel enjoyed a book called "The Legend of Reid Astrea", a book about Reid's deeds written by someone who was familiar with him.

It's likely that from it he picked up his favorite proverb, "Reid unsheathed his sword before the dragon, and smiled."

Arc 1 has a theme of "Beginning", Arc 2 has a theme of "Trust", Arc 3 has a theme of "Self-Awareness", and Arc 4 has a theme of "Self-Reliance".

The author has also given some impressions about the other Arcs, though they are not themes per se.

The author has commented that the feelings of "Deadlock" in Arc 5, "Despair" in Arc 6, "Impatience" in Arc 7, "Urgency" in Arc 8 and "Tragic Heroism" in Arc 9 wouldn't lose out to either Arc 3 or 4, giving some hints about possible overarching themes in the Arcs

Q: How old is Otto's favorite dragon?

A: Verhoe has been together with Otto for a long time, and she came to the Suwen family when Otto had attained a certain degree of human nature, so at that point she was around ten years old. Thinking that thirteen years have passed since then, she's probably around twenty-three years old. Ground dragons live for around 100 years, so their ageing isn't that different from humans.

The Re: Zero world writes Japanese using its own writing system consisting of ro, ha and i-glyphs.

Ro-glyphs are a remap of the latin alphabet used in English today, whereas ha-glyphs represent Japanese kana, albeit with some of the kana reduced.

Finally i-glyphs are represented in the anime as heavily cursive English text, which may possibly be just a shortcut by Whitefox.

In all, Whitefox has developed an intricate glyph system for these scripts, of which the mappings can be found on my Twitter.

A: I haven't decided on an exact value, but if you include the assets of the "Hoshin Company", she could probably buy up a medium-sized city. If not for the Royal Selection, one of her long-range goals was to buy a country.

The Great Rabbit was given the birthday the fifth of June.

This is due to a play on words with the word: "mugoi", which means brutal. The number 6 (for June) can have a reading of "mu", and the number 5 (for the day) can have a reading of "go",

so this is how the author created the play on words with the word: "mugoi".

The author mentioned then that the one who had killed Subaru the most brutal way had been the Great Rabbit, and thus that's how the Great Rabbit's birthday was decided.

According to the author, if Subaru hadn't been summoned to another world, he'd have been told off by Kenichi around the time he would have graduated High School. He'd then be supported to return to society in Kenichi's Workplace. Subaru would then take ~two years to enter university, graduate (though as a loner), become a proper, full-fledged member of society, and while having a certain amount of composure, plus the merits of those essentials, he would honestly be living life as a full-fledged member of society.

He'd then cling to a kouhai, who has a heart like Rem's, who finds the fact he's a dolt cute. They would enjoy a normal marriage and live reasonably happily ever after.

According to Tappei, if you pay attention to Raksha's hair colour, Kadomon Risch's wife, you can see that she is related to a certain character who has that hair colour in the novels.

The most common speculation is that she's Grimm & Carol's daughter.

Despite being renown for the Re: Zero Novel, which began in 2012, Nagatsuki Tappei's experience with novel writing didn't begin then.

In 2013, he said that he'd been writing novels for ten years already, however it's unknown if he ever released any.

最初にまず、「異世界召喚された主人公が、『死に戻り』の能力だけ抱えて、王様候補のヒロインを王様にするために死に戻りしつつ頑張る」という設定だけ考えてました。<br/>
それを友人に話し、ファミレスで半日だべって大まかなストーリーラインを形成。そのあと、帰って書き始めて三日後ぐらいから投稿開始――の流れです。<br/>
面白い作品になるよう、構想自体は常に練っていますが、骨組みに肉付けしながら書き進めてるといった感じでしょうか。純粋に構想期間の話をすると半日……になってしまうので、細かい設定の詰めなど考慮して一週間ぐらいになると思います。<br/>
とはいえ、自分も小説は書き始めて１０年選手ですから、一度書き始めてしまえばそれなりに物語を構成する能力はあるつもりです。<br/>
まず、小説を書き始めるのであれば、超長編よりも文庫本１冊ぐらいの中編を目指しましょう。完結するまで何本か書いて、文章力や発想力が身につけばあとは勢いでなんでも書けます。<br/>
<br/>
ＬＥＮＥＹ様の作品が読める日を楽しみにしております。<br/>
書き始めても、この作品を読むのはやめないでね！<br/>

He scrapped the idea though, and went for Amue instead.

This includes: flushable toilets, fridges, cameras and toothbrushes.

　最近web巡りしてて気になったんですけど、この話の王選のくだりって有名な元ネタがあるんですか？<br/>
　それともwebで公開されてる「近衛騎士」「王選」等のキーワードで引っかかるやつからぱくっただけですか？<br/>
　さすがに「王族が全滅したので近衛騎士が探しに出る」「後継候補である５人の姫が見つかる」「ヒロインがハーフエルフで魔女で忌み嫌われてる」これほど共通点があるのに偶然とは考えにくいです……。<br/>

一応、そちらの作品の方に目を通させていただきましたところ、なるほどかなりの類似点がありました。<br/>
自分としては元ネタ自体はゲームのラングリッサーシリーズから着想を得た話なので、ちょっと苦しいですが偶然というしかないんですが……。<br/>
<br/>
ともあれ、該当作品の最後までは見ていないので、着地点は違うものになるかと思われます。<br/>
そちらの作品の最後は、当作品の完結までは見ないつもりでいますので、今後の展開まで被った場合、その時点で盗作と判断していただいて構いません。<br/>
一度、感想で先の展開読まれたことがあるので、まさか……とは思っているのですが。<br/>

According to the author, there aren't many people who hold feelings of affection, in a romantic sense, towards Emilia.

That's both because she's regarded as a half-devil, and because she's so beautiful that some just think it impossible.

Subaru's ignominious title, "Lolimancer", was coined between Arc 4 and 5 by Shorty Megan of the "Dragon News" - a popular newspaper in Lugunica.

He came up with the title after seeing Subaru and Beatrice's relationship during the interview.

And for some more clarity, he coined the title trying to come up with something appropriate since the other Knights to the Royal Candidates all held cool titles.

In the end he settled on Lolimancer... And well, it had quite the impact and spread all around Lugunica!

In his battle against Emilia, Melakuera proclaimed she was a Witch Reincarnation.

However, he also proclaimed history was a spiral, and that she was an error endlessly repeated and transmigrated, implying he had witnessed this all before.

- The second bit was unfortunately all cut from the Anime.

  Also, the way Melakuera phrased it, regarding the "error" part, it could be referring specifically to the situation than Emilia herself. The Japanese phrasing does not make it clear.

Today is Subaru's birthday in Japan! Thus let's have a Subaru-themed trivia!

According to the author in 2014, if Subaru were to come up with a nickname for himself, he would go for: The Avenger who Crosses through Time: “Revenge Countdown".

When asked about whether Echidna was interested in erotic stuff, the author replied with a brief, yet to the point "endlessly".

Signifying that Echidna also has an inexhaustible curiousity about all things erotic.

Though Otto is said to resemble his mother the most, in "The Search Chronicle for the Missing Boy 4", Roswaal claims Otto got his eye and hair colour from his father instead.

But, given their official designs, this can only be chalked to be a mistake.

As soon as the journey to Picoutatte began, Beatrice has been in a state of near-constant rest, conserving her energy as she's unable to receive mana from anyone but Subaru.

She will likely stay like that until they find Subaru in Vollachia.

Natsuki Subaru has a grip strength of over 70 Kilograms with his dominant hand.

In contrast, the average grip strength for a male under the age of 20 is only said to be about 45 Kilograms.

Meaning Subaru's grip strength is far above average.

えー、四章で四割です。なぜなら十章編成で真面目に一歩ずつ進んでるから！<br/>
とりあえず、四章はスバルの進化第一段階の予定です。進化っつっても、別に強くなったりするアレではありませんが、人間的な問題で。メラからメラミになるところです。<br/>
メラゾーマとカイザーフェニックスにもいずれご期待ください。<br/>

<br/>
『ゼロ』を読むよう勧めてくれた友達に<br/>
スバルカッコいい！と言ってもあまり共感されません・・・。<br/>

スバル気に入らなかったら読むの苦痛でしょーがないと思うんだけど、謎だ！<br/>
<br/>
でもまあなんとかしてあげるよ！<br/>
４章のスバル、かなりかっちょいいからね！<br/>
４章でようやくメラミだから。メラゾーマしてカイザーフェニックスまでまだまだ先だけど、とりあえず４章でメラミだから！<br/>

In WhiteFox's Anime adaptation, Roswaal B Mathers - the descendant of the original Roswaal - was voice acted by Kouki Koyasu.

Kouki is the son of Takehito Koyasu, who stars as Roswaal himself. Meaning, it was truly a parent-child performance.
