Reinhard had the Divine Protection of Mind-Changing when he was four. This D.P. is renown to be extremely dangerous since it can change someone's mind, even having the potential to topple nations.

Sphinx is imprisoned underground the Barielle Territory and is biding her time for when to put her plans into action in creating a "Paradise".

It seems that the Zombies in Pride, Prejudice and Zombies were down to her "children" taking premature action.

Character limit didn't let me include this tidbit, but she's controlling a horde of rats which she regards as her "children", and conversely they regard her as their Creator. It's likely that the Parasite in Pride, Prejudice and Zombies was a result of one of Sphinx's creations.

Melakuera was originally a Minute Spirit born of a bonfire tended by the youngest of a family of travelers.

The boy would pray to the fire for peace; on his death, the Spirit grew a sense of self and became the Arbitrator for the world for his friend.

Once again the Twitter char limit made me cut out a bunch of details. For example, Melakuera was initially the name of said boy. Melakuera took his name on his death. Also, he became the Arbitrator specifically to uphold his friend's prayers for peace and tranquility.
