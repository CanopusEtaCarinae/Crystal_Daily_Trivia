Reinhard had the Divine Protection of Mind-Changing when he was four. This D.P. is renown to be extremely dangerous since it can change someone's mind, even having the potential to topple nations.

It seems that Reinhard deleted this D.P. from himself.

Sphinx is imprisoned underground the Barielle Territory and is biding her time for when to put her plans into action in creating a "Paradise".

It seems that the Zombies in Pride, Prejudice and Zombies were down to her "children" taking premature action.

Character limit didn't let me include this tidbit, but she's controlling a horde of rats which she regards as her "children", and conversely they regard her as their Creator. It's likely that the Parasite in Pride, Prejudice and Zombies was a result of one of Sphinx's creations.

Melakuera was originally a Minute Spirit born of a bonfire tended by the youngest of a family of travelers.

The boy would pray to the fire for peace; on his death, the Spirit grew a sense of self and became the Arbitrator for the world for his friend.

Once again the Twitter char limit made me cut out a bunch of details. For example, Melakuera was initially the name of said boy. Melakuera took his name on his death. Also, he became the Arbitrator specifically to uphold his friend's prayers for peace and tranquility.

Thus he was fitted with a prosthetic hook instead.

Witchbeasts are, for the most part, edible creatures, though their taste is so repugnant that it's often the case that you would only eat one in the direst of circumstances.

Meanwhile, that was what Shaula lived on for all of those 400 years.

ダフネちゃんは食べるものの量と質（味の良さ）、どちらを大切にしているのでしょう？魔獣とかいう不味そうな生物や大兎みたいな無限増殖、白鯨みたいな巨体を創ったことから考えると量を大事にしているのかな。
味も大切ですが、基本量です。満腹感を満たすことだけが、ダフネの生き甲斐です。でも、拒食症も併発しているので食べたものをすぐ吐いてしまうこともあります。

三大魔獣でいちばんおいしいのはどれですか？
大兎が柔らかくて美味しいですが、白鯨は高値で取引されそうです。黒蛇は珍味ですが、毒抜き必須。そこまでして食いたいか

白鯨の唐揚げ、大兎のソテー、黒蛇の黒焼きの中で一番美味しいのはどれですか
その中なら大兎のソテーだろうけど、ソテーする前に食材にならないように頑張ってね。

白鯨や大兎、黒蛇は普通の人間が食べて美味しいと感じられます？
おいしいわけがない。「食えればいいや」の精神で作られた生き物だぞ。

大兎は美味しいんじゃないんでしたっけ？
食った奴がいないからわかんないよ。おいしいんじゃない？的な答えだよ。兎だし。クジラや蛇よりはマシだろう。

くじらさん、うさぎさん、へびさんを作った魔女は何を考えていたんですか？
おなかすいた

もしかしてダフネってくじらさん、うさぎさん、へびさん食べれるんですか？
食べれますよ？

へびさんを食べれるということはダフネは病気にならないんですか？
あれを見ろ。どう見ても病気だ。

ダフネさんなんで兎や鯨食べなかったんですか？
全部は食べなかっただけです

ダフネさん兎や鯨を全部食べない自制心あったんですね。驚きです。
そりゃあ、我が子ですもの。子を丸のみする親がいようか。ちゃんとちょっとずつ味わう過程で魔獣が逃げ切りました
