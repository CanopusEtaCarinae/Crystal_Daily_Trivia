Priscilla Barielle's real name is Prisca Benedict. She's one of the children of Drizen Vollachia, 76th Vollachian Emperor. She lost the Imperial Selection due to her bodyguard Arrachia's lack of faith in her, resulting in her death being faked.

Reinhard had the Divine Protection of Mind-Changing when he was four. This D.P. is renown to be extremely dangerous since it can change someone's mind, even having the potential to topple nations.

It seems that Reinhard deleted this D.P. from himself.

Capella seems to be going after legacies that were left behind by the Witches 400 years ago. This was evident nine years ago when she commanded her "Son" Reisel to go after Scarfdona.

Reisel failed and as a result was transformed into something inhuman.

Frederica has rare blood flowing through her veins; among its properties it's said to even be able to captivate dragons.

Tappei has mentioned that Frederica's time to shine will be Arc 11, so she may be instrumental to Roswaal's plans against Volcanica

Sphinx is imprisoned underground the Barielle Territory and is biding her time for when to put her plans into action in creating a "Paradise".

It seems that the Zombies in Pride, Prejudice and Zombies were down to her "children" taking premature action.

Character limit didn't let me include this tidbit, but she's controlling a horde of rats which she regards as her "children", and conversely they regard her as their Creator. It's likely that the Parasite in Pride, Prejudice and Zombies was a result of one of Sphinx's creations.

There are 10 ridiculously powerful swords in Re Zero. All of their names have been revealed, but we don't know the whereabouts of some.

Of those we do, we have the Yang Sword, the Dragon Sword Reid, the Fiend Sword Murasame and the Dream Sword Masayume

Yae Tenzen was a maid that worked for the Barielle household that came under Priscilla's command when Leip died.

In "Pride, Prejudice and Zombies" Yae seemingly assassinated Priscilla but her death was seemingly reversed by Al, who then defeated Yae.
